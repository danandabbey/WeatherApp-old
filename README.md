# WeatherApp

This is a common weather app that has the current weather on top, a chart with data covering the next 12 hours in the middle, and a graph of sorts at the bottom with the next 5 days weather predictions.

This app uzilizes React, Chart.js, and Vite and Axios

To get this up and running inside the project folder:
open terminal:

1. run 'npm i'
2. run 'npm run dev' and click on the localhost link in termimal.

As far as completing the feature list:
I Used arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed my app.
I also Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
I Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)
I Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
I Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
I Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc).
I Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.
